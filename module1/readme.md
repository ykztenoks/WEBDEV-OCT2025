# Module 1: Web Development Fundamentals ðŸš€

This module introduces the core building blocks of web development, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and DOM manipulation for dynamic content. It culminates in a hands-on game project to apply these concepts. The content is organized by weeks for progressive learning.

## Topics Covered

- **HTML**

  - Basic structure of an HTML document (DOCTYPE, head, body)
  - Common tags (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links)
  - Semantic elements (header, nav, section, article, footer)
  - Forms and input elements
  - Tables and multimedia embedding

- **CSS**

  - Selectors (element, class, ID, attribute)
  - Box model (margin, border, padding, content)
  - Layout techniques (flexbox, grid)
  - Styling text, colors, and backgrounds
  - Transitions and animations
  - Responsive design with media queries

- **JavaScript**

  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control structures (if-else, loops, switch)
  - Functions and scope
  - Arrays and objects
  - Error handling and debugging
  - ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals)

- **DOM Manipulation**

  - Selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector)
  - Modifying content and attributes
  - Event listeners and handling user interactions
  - Creating and removing elements dynamically
  - Traversing the DOM tree

- **Game Project**

  - Building a simple interactive game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Memory Match)
  - Integrating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic
  - Handling game states, user inputs, and win/lose conditions
  - Adding animations and sound effects for enhanced user experience

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
