# Module 3: Backend Development with Node.js and Express ðŸš€

This module focuses on backend development using Node.js and Express.js, integrated with MongoDB via Mongoose. It includes handling CORS for cross-origin requests, secure authentication with JWT, and password hashing with bcrypt. The content is organized by weeks for progressive learning, culminating in a fullstack project to build a secure RESTful API integrated with a React frontend.

## Topics Covered

- **Node.js**

  - Runtime environment and event loop
  - Modules, npm, and package management
  - Asynchronous I/O and callbacks
  - File system and streams

- **Express.js**

  - Server setup and configuration
  - Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Middleware functions
  - Request/response handling and error management

- **MongoDB**

  - NoSQL database basics
  - Collections, documents, and queries
  - Indexing and aggregation

- **Mongoose**

  - ODM for MongoDB
  - Schemas, models, and validation
  - CRUD operations with Mongoose
  - Population and relationships

- **CORS**

  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing concepts
  - Enabling CORS in Express
  - Handling preflight requests

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**

  - Token-based authentication
  - Generating and verifying tokens
  - Protecting routes with middleware

- **Bcrypt**

  - Password hashing and salting
  - Secure storage of user credentials
  - Comparing hashed passwords

- **Project: Fullstack Application**

  - Building a full backend API with Express and MongoDB
  - User authentication (register/login) using JWT and bcrypt
  - Protected CRUD endpoints
  - Creating a React app for the frontend
  - Integrating frontend with backend (e.g., fetching data, handling auth)
  - Deploying the fullstack app for end-to-end functionality

Happy learning! ðŸ’»
